Research Question: 

Admission rates of colleges and universities in the United States can be drastically different from one another and this can be due to a variety of reasons, such as lack of facilities, cost, or even the demographics of the applicants themselves. The purpose of this project is to investigate which of the factors/variables in the provided dataset best explains the variation observed in admission rates for 1508 colleges and universities in the U.S. While the primary use of the model you will build is for description and understanding of the factors affecting admission rates, it may also be used to predict admission rates for schools with certain characteristics. Therefore, the model you decide is best for explaining this variation in admission rates between schools must be both simple enough for various stakeholders to understand (e.g. prospective students, university administrators, etc.), but also complicated enough and with all necessary theoretical properties required to make good predictions. You will need to find a model that balances these two properties: not overly complicated or hard to interpret, but also having reasonable properties that allow for decent predictions and inference.

A data dictionary, outlining the variables included in the dataset and how they are coded/represented is provided along with these instructions.
